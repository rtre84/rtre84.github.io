<!--# Christopher Sexton's CV -->

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px;">Hello, I'm Anup.</span>

I am a software engineer that has done a fair bit of graphic design, project management and system administration. I love to build stuff, learn quickly, want to do it right, and I care about the details. I enjoy wearing lots of hats and doing many different things, from subtle UI tweaks to scaling systems to handle millions of users.

I love to pair program but am comfortable taking on a project solo. I have experience working with and leading geographically distributed teams. I want to understand the business side of things, make real decisions, and I want to work on a project that I can believe in.


## Experience

### Codeography

##### Captured for Mac

<div style="float: right" class="noprint"><img src="/cv/images/captured.png"></div>

Quick Screenshot Sharing for Mac. Take a screenshot and [Captured](/captured) will automatically upload it to the image hosting service of your choice, then copy the link to your clipboard. Supports Imgur, Dropbox, SFTP and Amazon S3.

Keeps track of screen shot history, and can shorten image urls with Bit.ly.

##### Task Me

<div style="float: right" class="noprint"><img src="/cv/images/taskme.png"></div>

[Task Me](/taskme) streamlines the process of sending yourself a reminder email from your iPhone.  Task Me removes any repetitive steps for sending yourself simple email notes, with a simple interface and easy setup.

Both Gmail and MobileMe have easy setup built right in, but Task Me can also be configured manually to be used with most SMTP servers.

### Ziplist
  <div class='byline'>
  Senior Principal Engineer
  <br/>
  2010-Present
  </div>

I worked primarirly on the ZipList's web app, which was implemented in Ruby on Rails. Occationally consulting on the mobile applications. Contributed on everything from backend infrastructure to the re-brandable front end.

### Symantec, Swapdrive Division
  <div class='byline'>
  Senior Development Manager/Principal Engineer
  <br/>
  2005-2010
  </div>

This began as a tiny start up company, Swapdrive. When I first started there was only one other programmer in the office. Being a rag-tag small company, we had to make it work ourselves or we would fail. This was my real foray into the business of software, and learn how to interact with massive corporations and small partners. I got to take on responsibility that I would have never considered, including interviewing and building teams, driving process decisions, and actually shipping products under insane schedules.

I was one of 3 developer leads and played a key role in exiting the company for [$124M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Symantec).

#### The Big Products

##### Norton Online Backup

<div style="float: right" class="noprint"><img src="/cv/images/nobu.png"></div>

Created a new Norton-branded product in 9 months. This consisted of a small agent that would run on the client computers and talk via a REST API to the Ruby on Rails application. My primary role was in developing the Rails application, but I also developed other supporting components from the database schema to the Event Machine based polling servers. I also designed the physical infrastructure and trained a Windows centric datacenter staff to support Linux applications.

Version 2 of Norton Online Backup included a complete port of the backup engine to Mac. My primary responsibilities were shifted to supporting the Mac client and the new posix-compliant backup engine. Despite the fact that we had to port our entire client, as well as make all the customizations in the web application to support this new platform we were able to add functionality and ship in 8 months. We received great reviews in the press and with the help of our partners grew our new customer rate to a steady 10,000 new users a day.

Post v2 we added mobile devices, when we released iPhone, Android apps and focused on lowering error rates and increasing conversions.


##### Dell DataSafe Online

<!--div style="float: right"><img src="http://i.dell.com/images/global/services/screenshot.jpg"></div-->
<div style="float: right" class="noprint"><img src="/cv/images/dso.png"></div>

I started this project from scratch and worked closely with Dell's design team to build a fully branded and integrated application. I managed the entire technical side of this product, and coded the desktop client. This client went through two iterations: v1.0 MFC/C++ with a custom built integrated web server for the local html front end; and v1.1, which was written in C#.NET. In v2.0 this product was migrated to a white label version of Norton Online Backup.

DataSafe was very exciting, and there was always something new and challenging. I supported Michael Dell directly by developing the slides he used to unveil DataSafe Online in his CES 2007 keynote. I also supported a spin-off project where we integrated our back end storage into their factories for PC to PC Migration.

#### Odd Jobs and Other Responsibilities

I was the SCM Czar. Not necessarily a job I wanted, or one that was directly given to me, but rather something that happened over time. This was large part due to the fact that I did the migration from Perforce to Subversion and later to Git.

I setup, maintained and customized a wiki and ticket system, and then was able to pull of the social engineering feats necessary to get people to use it.

I had a few smaller projects that involved web design. For example, I rebranded whalemail.com and Backup.com for Business.

 * [Dotfiles](http://github.com/csexton/dotfiles) - You can tell alot about a coder by what they put in their `.dotfiles`.

### Background

In addition to my obsession with computers I also have other interests.

I study and teach a Chinese martial art, Wushu. In fact I made the [US National Team in 2005](http://www.usawkf.com/news/detail.php?aid=334), and was able to represent my country at the Wushu World Championships and Pan American Wushu Games.

Being a big fan of BBQ I enjoy cooking large cuts of meat on the smoker for long amounts of time. I hope to perfect this craft, but it is going to require more practice.

I am also a dad, and take great pride in my two beautiful children. They are, without doubt, the best thing in my life.
